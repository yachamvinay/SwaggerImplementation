# SwaggerImplementation

This is sample Spring Project of Student Management with some operations and this project is developed using Swagger UI 

So in order to execute the this project first we need to run the Spring Project and then after succesfully completion of execution in browser we need to pass the url as just like below

--> http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html#/student-controller/

When you run the above url in browser

you will get Swagger-UI then what ever the operations you need to perform you just perform there

Thank you.
